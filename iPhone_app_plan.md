- **Data Storage**: Core Data + UserDefaults

### Key Components

#### 1. Network Layer
```swift
protocol WeatherServiceProtocol {
    func fetchCurrentWeather(location: Location) async throws -> WeatherData
    func fetchHistoricalData(location: Location, date: Date) async throws -> HistoricalData
    func subscribeToAlerts(email: String, location: Location) async throws -> SubscriptionResponse
    func unsubscribeFromAlerts(email: String) async throws -> UnsubscribeResponse
}
```

#### 2. Location Services
```swift
class LocationManager: NSObject, ObservableObject {
    @Published var currentLocation: CLLocation?
    @Published var authorizationStatus: CLAuthorizationStatus
    
    func requestLocationPermission()
    func startLocationUpdates()
    func reverseGeocode(location: CLLocation) async throws -> String
}
```

#### 3. Push Notification Handler
```swift
class NotificationManager: NSObject, ObservableObject {
    func requestNotificationPermission()
    func registerForRemoteNotifications()
    func handleNotification(_ notification: UNNotification)
    func scheduleLocalNotification(for alert: TemperatureAlert)
}
```

#### 4. Data Models
```swift
struct WeatherData: Codable {
    let temperature: Double
    let location: String
    let timestamp: Date
    let condition: String
}

struct TemperatureAlert: Codable {
    let id: UUID
    let location: String
    let currentTemp: Double
    let averageTemp: Double
    let difference: Double
    let timestamp: Date
    let severity: AlertSeverity
}

enum AlertSeverity: String, Codable {
    case moderate = "moderate"    // 10-15°F above average
    case high = "high"           // 15-20°F above average
    case extreme = "extreme"      // 20°F+ above average
}
```
