        Welcome to the Climate Movement!
        
        Thank you for joining the "IT'S TOO HOT!" climate awareness campaign. 
        You're now part of a growing community of activists working to raise 
        awareness about climate change.
        
        What happens next:
        - We'll monitor temperatures in your area ({location})
        - When temperatures are {TEMP_THRESHOLD}¬∞F+ hotter than historical averages, you'll get an alert
        - Wear your "IT'S TOO HOT!" shirt on those days to raise awareness
        - Start conversations about climate change with friends and family
        
        Your "IT'S TOO HOT!" shirt is your climate activism uniform. When you wear it 
        on climate anomaly days, you're showing the world that climate change is real 
        and happening now.
        
        Ready to make a difference? Share this campaign with your friends:
        https://its2hot.org
        
        Together, we can raise awareness and drive climate action!
