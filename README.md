# Project Overview

**Too Hot** is a climate activism platform that alerts you when your local temperature is significantly hotter than historical averages. When these climate anomalies occur, we encourage wearing "IT'S TOO HOT!" t-shirts to raise awareness and start important conversations about climate action.

# Key Features
- **Temperature Monitoring:** Checks your local weather against historical averages
- **Smart Alerts:** Notifies you when temperatures are 1Â°F+ hotter than normal
- **Push Notifications:** Mobile and web alerts for extreme heat events
- **E-commerce:** Order "IT'S TOO HOT!" shirts (Printful + PayPal integration)
