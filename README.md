# Mobile App (React Native/Expo)

The mobile app is in [`its2hot-app/`](its2hot-app/). It is a cross-platform (iOS/Android/web) Expo app for:
- Push notifications for temperature alerts
- T-shirt shop and purchase flow
- Climate data and campaign info

## Features
- **Home:** Enable/disable notifications, campaign info, climate data
- **Shop:** Browse, select, and purchase shirts (PayPal integration)
- **Too Hot Today:** See today's temperature anomaly and share

## Setup & Development
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd its2hot-app
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   - Open in Expo Go, iOS/Android simulator, or web browser

## Configuration
- See [`its2hot-app/app.json`](its2hot-app/app.json) for bundle IDs, notification icons, etc.
- Uses Firebase for push notifications (see `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist`)
- Main dependencies: Expo, React Native, @react-navigation, expo-notifications, firebase

## Main Screens
- **HomeScreen:** Enable notifications, campaign info, climate data
- **ShopScreen:** Select shirt design, color, size, quantity, and purchase
- **TooHotTodayScreen:** See and share today's temperature anomaly

- **Checkout:** `/checkout` (web)
- **PayPal:** Secure payment processing (sandbox/live)
- **Printful:** Automatic order fulfillment via API
- **Order confirmation:** Email sent to customer
- **Admin:** View/manage orders and logs

See [PRINTFUL_SETUP_GUIDE.md](PRINTFUL_SETUP_GUIDE.md) and [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for full details.

# Deployment (Docker & GCP)

## Docker (Local)
1. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Google Cloud Run
- See [GCP_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](GCP_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for full instructions
- Key steps:
  1. Build and push Docker image
  2. Deploy to Cloud Run with all environment variables set
  3. Set up Cloud Scheduler jobs for temperature checks
  4. Configure domain and SSL (optional)

## Cloud Build Example
See [`cloudbuild.yaml`](cloudbuild.yaml) for automated build/deploy steps.

# Temperature Alert System

## Architecture
The temperature alert system uses a **single Cloud Run service** with integrated scheduling:

- **Main App**: Flask application handling web interface, API endpoints, email/push notifications, and scheduler endpoints
- **Cloud Scheduler**: GCP managed service that triggers temperature checks via HTTP requests
- **Database Logging**: All temperature checks are logged with detailed information

## How It Works
1. **Historical Data**: Fetches 30 years of historical temperature data for each location
2. **Current Forecast**: Gets today's forecasted high temperature
3. **Comparison**: Compares current vs. 30-year average
4. **Alert Threshold**: Configurable threshold (1Â°F for development, 10Â°F for production)
5. **Notifications**: Sends email and push notifications when threshold is exceeded

## Scheduler Jobs
- **Daily Check**: Runs at 8 AM every day
- **Hourly Check**: Runs every hour from 6 AM to 8 PM (development)
- **Peak Hours Check**: Runs at 12 PM and 4 PM (development)

## Configuration
- **Threshold**: Toggle between 1Â°F (development) and 10Â°F (production)
- **Frequency**: Toggle between hourly (development) and daily (production)
- **Settings**: Managed via admin dashboard or environment variables

---

### Scheduler Issues
- **Health Status**: Check scheduler health indicator in admin dashboard
- **Cloud Scheduler Jobs**: Verify jobs are running in GCP Console
- **Logs**: Check scheduler logs for detailed error information
- **Manual Test**: Use "Test Check" button to verify functionality

### Email/Push Notifications
- **Email Settings**: Verify `MAIL_USERNAME` and `MAIL_PASSWORD`
