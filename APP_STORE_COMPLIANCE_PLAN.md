I asked Cursor's AI agent to help me make a plan for preparing to launch the app on the apple app store and google play store. Here's the prompt I used, and following it is the response that it gave me.

"Let's make a plan to bring the expo app into a fully compliant state for listing on the apple app store and the google play store. Check over our current implementation, and check the requirements from apple and from google for their app stores. Compare our current app state to their requirements; list any possible issues that may need to be addressed. Make a plan for how to address those issues. Write down in an MD file the full details of your findings."
